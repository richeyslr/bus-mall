## Lab 11 - Get started

As a user, I would like to display three unique products by chance so that the viewers can pick a favorite.
As a user, I would like to track the selections made by viewers so that I can determine which products to keep for the catalog.
As a user, I would like to control the number of rounds a user is presented with so that I can control the voting session duration.
As a user, I would like to view a report of results after all rounds of voting have concluded so that I can evaluate which products were the most popular.

To do:
make images line up left to right
make button appear after voting is done
