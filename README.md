## Lab 11 - Get started

As a user, I would like to display three unique products by chance so that the viewers can pick a favorite.
As a user, I would like to track the selections made by viewers so that I can determine which products to keep for the catalog.
As a user, I would like to control the number of rounds a user is presented with so that I can control the voting session duration.
As a user, I would like to view a report of results after all rounds of voting have concluded so that I can evaluate which products were the most popular.

## Lab 12 - Add a chart

Experiment with using Chart.js to implement a graph showing click data
[Resources:](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/bar/stacked.html) Chart.js stacked bar chart example 

To do:
prevent same product from showing up in back to back selections
make button appear after voting is done
make button render totals data
make totals data render in table form instead of list form
style bar chart to better represent data
consolidate while loop to check for dupes
